      <p>As I stepped into my web development class, I had no idea what to expect.
        I was excited, yet nervous, about diving into the world of coding. Little did I know, this journey would transform me into a confident web developer.
Our instructor, [Mr Danso], welcomed us with a clear plan and enthusiasm that was contagious. The first few classes laid the foundation, introducing us to the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was fascinated by how lines of code came to life on the screen.

To reinforce our learning, [Mr Danso] encouraged us to create an account on FreeCodeCamp, an exceptional platform for hands-on experience. 
I eagerly completed the Responsive Web Design course, earning certifications that boosted my confidence.

But that was just the beginning. Next, we were tasked with hosting a website on a free hosting platform. I chose [tiny.site] and, with some trial and error, successfully deployed my first website.
 Seeing my creation live on the internet was exhilarating!

As the semester progressed, we delved deeper into web development, exploring topics like Bootstrap, React, and database integration. 
With each new challenge, I grew more proficient, tackling assignments and projects with ease.

One of the most significant accomplishments was creating a fully functional website from scratch.
 I designed, coded, and deployed it, feeling an overwhelming sense of pride. My hard work paid off, and I received positive feedback from [Mr Danso] and peers.
